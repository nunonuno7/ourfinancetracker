      This app is designed for busy (or lazy!) people who still want control over their finances with minimum effort.
      If you only do three things each month, the app can compute the rest for you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h5 mb-2">Only 3 things you must do every month</h2>
    <ol class="mb-3">
      <li><strong>Enter the balances of your accounts</strong> (bank and cash; investment accounts too if you track them).</li>
      <li><strong>Enter all your incomes</strong> for the month.</li>
      <li><strong>Record investment flows</strong> (money you move into investments and money you withdraw back).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="h5 mb-2">No time to enter expenses? We’ll estimate them.</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The app estimates your <strong>total monthly expenses</strong> from your balances and known cash flows.
      It uses <em>only non-investment (cash/bank)</em> accounts for this calculation and treats investment flows explicitly.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h6 mb-1">Formula (expenses estimate)</h3>
    <pre class="mb-3"><code>
Let:
  CashStart   = sum of non-investment (bank/cash) balances on the first day of the month
  CashEnd     = sum of non-investment balances on the last day of the month
  Incomes     = total Income recorded in the month
  InvestOut   = total moved from cash → investments during the month
  InvestIn    = total moved from investments → cash during the month

EstimatedExpenses = CashStart + Incomes + InvestIn − InvestOut − CashEnd
    </code></pre>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Intuition: starting cash plus money coming in (incomes and investment withdrawals),
      minus money you set aside into investments, minus the cash you still have at month end,
      equals the cash you must have spent.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h6 mb-1">If you add expenses manually</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      You can record expenses whenever you like. The app then shows the remaining estimate:
      <code>EstimatedExpensesRemaining = max(0, EstimatedExpenses − Sum(EnteredExpenses))</code>.
      As you add real expenses, the estimated amount shrinks accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h5 mb-2">Assumptions & tips</h2>
    <ul class="mb-0">
      <li>Use balances for <strong>non-investment</strong> accounts to drive the estimate (bank + wallet). Investment market changes are <em>not</em> treated as expenses.</li>
      <li>Transfers between non-investment accounts net to zero and don’t affect the estimate.</li>
      <li>Provide month-open and month-close balances (or consecutive monthly snapshots) so the math is consistent.</li>
      <li>If you want full detail, add expenses; if not, the estimate still gives you a reliable monthly spend number.</li>
    </ul>
